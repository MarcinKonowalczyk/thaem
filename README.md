# THAEM

THAEM uses waypoints to create a path for the player, which it also used to interact with enemies (bullets). The behaviour of all of the components of the game (player and the bullets) is related to the behaviour of many other components. Hence, they can be considered all to eb linked together. Also, I have gotten an ungodly amount of liker errors when compiling  the game, which alludes to the theme as well.
